This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## About web application
      
        CineSync is a cutting-edge web application that brings movie lovers
        together in a unique and exciting way. With CineSync, users can stream
        their favorite movies and TV shows online while engaging in a shared
        viewing experience with friends and family from all over the world.
        CineSync allows users to create private screening rooms where they can
        watch movies together in real-time, share comments and reactions, and
        enjoy an immersive and interactive movie-watching experience like no
        other.
      
        CineSync offers a wide range of features designed to enhance the
        movie-watching experience, including high-quality video and audio
        streaming, built-in chat functionality, customizable subtitles, and
        more. With its user-friendly interface and powerful search capabilities,
        CineSync makes it easy to find and stream the latest and greatest movies
        and TV shows from around the world.
      
        One of the standout features of CineSync is its use of webRTC
        technology, which allows users to watch movies together anonymously and
        securely without having to reveal their personal information or
        location. This ensures that users can enjoy their movies without
        worrying about their privacy or security being compromised.
      
        Whether you're looking for a fun and social way to watch movies with
        friends or simply want to enjoy your favorite films in a new and
        exciting way, CineSync is the perfect web application for movie lovers
        everywhere.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
